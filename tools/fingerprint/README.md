# Fingerprint measurement harness

Measures what this browser looks like to a fingerprinting script, and diffs it
against the real Google Chrome installed on the same machine. Used to produce
the *before* baseline and, after the masking work lands, the *after* table.

## Run

```bash
zig build -Dprebuilt_v8_path=v8/libc_v8.a        # the collector needs zig-out/bin/lightpanda

node tools/fingerprint/collect-lightpanda.mjs                  # -> results/before-lightpanda.json
node tools/fingerprint/collect-chrome.mjs                      # -> results/reference-chrome-headless.json
node tools/fingerprint/collect-chrome.mjs --headed             # -> results/reference-chrome-headed.json

node tools/fingerprint/diff.mjs \
  tools/fingerprint/results/before-lightpanda.json \
  tools/fingerprint/results/reference-chrome-headed.json \
  --out tools/fingerprint/results/before-vs-chrome.md
```

Node >= 22 only, no npm dependencies (global `WebSocket` and `fetch`).

## What each piece does

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `cdp.mjs` | ~100-line raw CDP client. Both engines go through it, so a difference in the snapshot comes from the engine, not from a driver. |
| `probe.js` | One async expression collecting ~90 fingerprint surface values. Every read is wrapped, so "this property throws" is recorded as data instead of aborting the run. |
| `header-echo.mjs` | Raw-TCP HTTP server that records the byte-exact request head. `node:http` reorders headers, and header order is itself part of the fingerprint. Serves a page pulling one of every fetch destination (document, style, script, image, iframe, fetch, xhr). |
| `sites.mjs` | URLs + in-page extractors for bot.sannysoft.com and CreepJS. |
| `subresource-check.mjs` | Answers "did the request happen at all", per fetch destination. Exits non-zero on a miss. Takes engine flags after `--`. |
| `collect-*.mjs` | Spawn the engine, run the four steps, write one JSON snapshot. |
| `dump-graphics.mjs` | Dumps Chrome's *whole* graphics API surface — every GLenum, every method's arity, every `getParameter` answer, every character's advance width. `probe.js` asks "what does a fingerprinting script see"; this asks "what exactly should we report". The Zig code under `src/browser/webapi/canvas/` is transcribed from its output. |
| `diff.mjs` | Renders a candidate/reference markdown comparison. |

## Two things to know before trusting a result

**Never verify with screenshots.** `Page.captureScreenshot` in this engine
returns a fixed `@embedFile` placeholder PNG (see `src/cdp/domains/page.zig`),
and `Page.printToPDF` likewise. An image proves nothing here; everything in this
harness reads the DOM or the wire instead.

**lightpanda allows one browser context at a time** — a second
`Target.createBrowserContext` fails with `Cannot have more than one browser
context at a time`, so the collectors reuse a single page across all four steps.

## Header-layer status (after P3)

On the document request, 13 of Chrome's 14 headers are now present, up from 6:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| headers present | 6/14 | 13/14 |
| missing | `Connection`, `Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile`, `Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform`, `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests`, `Sec-Fetch-Site/Mode/User/Dest` | `Connection` |
| headers Chrome doesn't send | none | none |

Three gaps remain at this layer, all measured rather than assumed:

1. **Header order still differs.** Chrome sends
   `host connection sec-ch-ua sec-ch-ua-mobile sec-ch-ua-platform upgrade-insecure-requests user-agent accept sec-fetch-site sec-fetch-mode sec-fetch-user sec-fetch-dest accept-encoding accept-language`;
   we send
   `host accept-encoding sec-ch-ua sec-ch-ua-mobile sec-ch-ua-platform user-agent accept-language accept sec-fetch-dest sec-fetch-mode sec-fetch-site upgrade-insecure-requests sec-fetch-user`.
   libcurl emits `Host` and `Accept-Encoding` from its own slots and appends the
   caller's slist after them, so the interleaving Chrome produces isn't
   reachable by ordering the slist alone. Closing this means either taking over
   curl's internal headers (supply `Host:` explicitly, blank out curl's
   defaults) or moving off libcurl for page requests.
2. **`Connection: keep-alive` is deliberately absent.** Chrome sends it on
   HTTP/1.1 only — the header is illegal in HTTP/2. Headers are built before
   the protocol version is known, so emitting it unconditionally would put an
   illegal header on every h2 request. Needs a version-aware hook.
3. **`Accept-Encoding` omits `zstd`.** Chrome sends `gzip, deflate, br, zstd`.
   The first three are now in Chrome's order, but advertising `zstd` when the
   bundled libcurl may not have it means a response we cannot decode.

## Subresource status (after S1–S3)

The two engine-level gaps P3 turned up — stylesheets and images never being
requested *at all* — are closed. `subresource-check.mjs` drives a page pulling
one of every fetch destination and reports what reaches the server:

| | after P3 | after S1–S3 |
|---|---|---|
| destinations requested | 5/8 | **8/8** |
| missing | `stylesheet`, `image`, `favicon` | none |

- **stylesheet** — the fetch already existed but was opt-in. The flag was
  inverted to `--disable-external-stylesheets` so CSS loads by default.
- **image** — new. `ResourceType.image` plus `Frame.loadImage`, which requests
  and discards the body; there is no decoder and none is needed.
- **favicon** — new. Requested once per top-level navigation after everything
  else, honouring `<link rel=icon>` and otherwise falling back to
  `/favicon.ico`.

Header values on those requests match the Chrome reference exactly: across all
eight destinations, all 40 compared values (`Accept`, `Sec-Fetch-Dest/Mode/Site`,
`Referer`) are identical to `reference-chrome-headed.json`, and no destination
sends a header Chrome doesn't.

The three gaps above are unchanged by this work and are the only remaining
differences on subresource requests too: every one still lacks `Connection`,
still orders headers differently, and still omits `zstd`. Nothing in the JS
probe moved either (33/90, 11 sannysoft FAILs) — this was a network-layer
change only.

## What the navigator work changed (P4)

Measured with `after-p4-lightpanda.json` against `reference-chrome-headed.json`;
the full table is `after-p4-vs-chrome.md`.

| | after subresources | after navigator |
|---|---|---|
| probe keys identical to Chrome | 33/90 | **52/90** |
| bot.sannysoft.com FAIL rows | 11 | **7** |

The seven that remain are all graphics: `WebGL Vendor`, `WebGL Renderer` and
`Canvas1`..`Canvas5`. Every non-graphics row sannysoft runs now passes,
including `Chrome (New)`, `HEADCHR_CHROME_OBJ`, `HEADCHR_PLUGINS`,
`Plugins Length`, `Plugins is of type PluginArray` and `CHR_BATTERY`.
`CHR_MEMORY` also flipped to pass without `performance.memory` being
implemented — observed, not explained.

What was added, all of it measured off the Chrome 150 install on this machine
rather than recalled — property attributes, prototype member lists and object
identity relations included:

- `navigator.plugins` / `navigator.mimeTypes` — Chrome's five hardcoded PDF
  viewer aliases and two MIME types. `JSON.stringify(navigator.plugins)` now
  produces the same string Chrome does.
- `window.chrome` — an ordinary object (not a platform object), with `app`,
  `csi` and `loadTimes` as own properties whose values are native functions.
- `navigator.connection`, `navigator.mediaDevices`, `navigator.getBattery`.
- Chrome's user-agent, client-hint brands and `appVersion` as the *defaults*.
  The four now derive from one version constant, so they cannot disagree.

Two residual differences worth knowing about:

- `navigator.userAgentData.getHighEntropyValues` returns `platformVersion: ""`
  where Chrome reports the OS version (`26.3.1` here). Reading it needs a
  platform-specific syscall. Everything else in that dictionary matches,
  including that only *requested* hints come back and that the hint is named
  `formFactors`, not `formFactor`.
- `hardwareConcurrency` (8) and `deviceMemory` (8) are deliberately fixed, so
  they differ from whatever the host really has — 10 and 16 on this machine.
  A fleet sharing one pair was preferred over fingerprinting differently on
  every machine.

The three header-layer gaps below are untouched by this work and still apply.

## Reference caveats

`--headless=new` Chrome 150 on this machine differs from headed Chrome in
exactly four probe values, so `reference-chrome-headed.json` is the column to
target:

- `navigator.userAgent` / `appVersion` say `HeadlessChrome` instead of `Chrome`
- `window.outerWidth` / `outerHeight` reflect the smaller default viewport
- `screen.availTop` is `0` instead of `33` (no menu bar), `availHeight` differs
- `screen.colorDepth` / `pixelDepth` are `24` instead of `30`

WebGL is *not* one of them: headless Chrome on macOS still reports the real
Metal/ANGLE renderer, so the GPU strings in either reference file are usable
targets.

## Graphics layer (after P5, WebGL half)

`getContext('webgl')` used to answer `null`, so bot.sannysoft.com failed *WebGL
Vendor* and *WebGL Renderer* outright, and `webgl.params` was absent from the
probe. All three now match Chrome:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `getContext('webgl' / 'webgl2' / 'experimental-webgl')` | `null`, `null`, `null` | `ok`, `ok`, `ok` |
| `getParameter(VENDOR)` | `""` | `WebKit` |
| `getParameter(UNMASKED_RENDERER_WEBGL)` | `""` | `ANGLE (Apple, ANGLE Metal Renderer: Apple M4, …)` |
| `getSupportedExtensions().length` | 39 (1.0 only) | 39 for 1.0, 36 for 2.0 |
| `WebGLRenderingContext.prototype` own properties | 4 | 441, the same as Chrome |
| `WebGL2RenderingContext` | absent | 790 own properties, the same as Chrome |
| sannysoft hard failures | WebGL Vendor, WebGL Renderer | none |

**Every value is measured, none recalled.** The WebGL spec pins the enum
numbering but says nothing about what a driver answers for `MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE`,
`SAMPLES` or the ANGLE renderer string — and those are exactly the values that
identify a machine. Run `dump-graphics.mjs` to regenerate
`results/reference-chrome-graphics.json`, then update the Zig to match. Two
values came out the *opposite* of what reasoning suggested, and only the
measurement caught them: a fence sync nothing was queued behind reports
`UNSIGNALED`, not `SIGNALED`, and a zero-timeout wait on it reports
`TIMEOUT_EXPIRED`, not `ALREADY_SIGNALED`.

Known deviations from Chrome at this layer, all deliberate:

1. **The handle types inherit from `Object`, not from `WebGLObject`.** In Chrome
   `Object.getPrototypeOf(WebGLBuffer.prototype) === WebGLObject.prototype`, and
   a `WebGLObject` global exists. Reproducing that means a chained-factory
   allocation per handle for a prototype link nothing calls.
2. **`isQuery` / `isVertexArray` / `isTransformFeedback` always answer `false`,
   and `isBuffer` / `isTexture` / … always answer `true` for a live handle.**
   Chrome's answer depends on whether the object was ever bound; we keep no
   binding state. The constants match the measured never-bound case.
3. **Nothing rasterizes.** A page that waits for WebGL output before revealing
   content waits forever rather than taking its no-WebGL path. This is the
   trade-off accepted in exchange for not being the only browser on the machine
   without WebGL; see the comment in `element/html/Canvas.zig`.
4. **`WebGLContextEvent` is not exposed**, so a script cannot construct one or
   find it on `window`. No `webglcontextlost` event is ever fired either, since
   the context is never lost.

The canvas-2D half of P5 — `toDataURL`, a real pixel buffer behind
`getImageData`, and `measureText` — is not done yet. The measurements it needs
are already in `results/reference-chrome-graphics.json`: the `canvas2d` section
has Chrome's exact PNG bytes for empty and solid-fill canvases at four sizes,
and the `text` section has per-character advance widths for all four distinct
font-metric families. Two facts from that data shape the implementation:
`measureText` is *exactly* linear in font size, and a string's width is the
plain sum of its characters' advances except across a kerning pair (`AV`, `To`),
so a scaled advance table reproduces `mmmmmmmmmmlli` and `Cwm fjordbank glyphs
vext quiz` to the last bit.
